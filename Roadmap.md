## Done:

✔️ - get updated stream network from HLNUG

✔️ - check stream network for connectivity issues

✔️ - select most recent Bio data per location

✔️ - check congruency of Bio data with network and snap if needed

✔️ - repeat above for WWTP, storm water overflow & barrier data

✔️ - allocate info from point features to bio sampling sites using
stream- and segment number system

## To do:

⚪ - query osm Highways and extract crossings with stream network

⚪ - extract stream structural quality at Bio sampling locations

⚪ - load in CORINE land cover and data on riparian zones

⚪ - create stream line buffers and extract data from riparian zones

⚪ - create individual catchments from Bio sampling locations

⚪ - extract CORINE Data using catchments

⚪ - run & evaluate boosted regression trees

⚪ - incoorperate other variables
